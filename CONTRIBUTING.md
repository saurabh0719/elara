# Contributing Guidelines :

Contributions can be bug fixes, documentation updates, minor patches, feature requests etc.
Before contributing ensure you've read and understood the [documentation](https://github.com/saurabh0719/elara#readme).

* Open a new [issue](https://github.com/saurabh0719/elara/issues) first, explaining the problem. 
  - If you're reporting a bug, please include steps (or code) to reproduce the bug.
  - If you're issuing a feature request, please mention why it will be useful or the use case it solves.
  - If you intend to implement the new feature request OR fix a bug yourself, then give a brief outline of the proposed solution.

* Fork the `main` branch and make your changes. Ensure that the new code is formatted with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)
  
* You can issue a new [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the `main` branch that closes the issue *after* you've been assigned.
  - Any non-trivial pull request without having opened an earlier issue will be closed.
  - Large (or new feature) pull requests must be accompanied with relevant tests if necessary. 
  
* Please be patient, respectful and inclusive while commenting on issues and pull requests
